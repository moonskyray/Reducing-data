Reducing data - R Project for Statistical Computing

I used R software to delete the other columns in the data, and only retained the "value" and "brand", and analyzed the value scores of each brand. A bar chart is drawn to facilitate the observation of the value relationship of each brand. It can be seen from the graph that the highest value score of brand g is 7.35.

It is my great honor to participate in the Google code-in competition, which enables me to learn a lot of knowledge and have many new experiences. Thanks to all of Google!
